# docker
- Docker üê≥ is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.
- With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. 
- ‚ÄúDockerized‚Äù apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues‚Äô OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.
- Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. 
- Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. 
- With Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.
